[Ruijie Gao](.) is an undergraduate Electrical Engineering (EE) student, anticipated to graduate in the summer of 2025. With a keen interest in **computer architecture**, **hardware/software co-design**, and **machine learning accelerators**, Ruijie has been immersing himself in groundbreaking research and academic pursuits. Under the guidance of [Dr. Yu Zeng](https://yuzeng2333.github.io) from Princeton University, Ruijie has gained valuable knowledge and experience in his chosen field.

A devoted CLI enthusiast, Ruijie uses Arch Linux as his desktop operating system, embracing the power and flexibility it offers. His affinity for innovative technology extends to hardware design, where he enjoys using Chisel as his preferred design tool, expressing a strong dislike for [Verilog](http://danluu.com/why-hardware-development-is-hard/). Ruijie's interests are not limited to engineering; he is also an ardent lover of musicals, with Hamilton and Rent ranking among his favorites.

As Ruijie Gao continues his academic journey, he remains committed to his dream of becoming a professional in the field of computer architecture. With the support of his mentors and driven by his love for the community, Ruijie is eager to make meaningful contributions to the world of technology and beyond.
